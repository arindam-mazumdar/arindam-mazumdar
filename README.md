### Welcome to my profile!

Hi all, 

My projects reflect my journey from cosmology to data science 

#### Data Science Projects

- Domestic power usage prediction
- Image recognition using Convolutional Neural Network
- Heart-Check


#### Cosmology

I did my PhD on the effect of an early universe process called preheating on Cosmic Microwave Background. During my last two postdoctoral tenures, I worked on different particle physics models and their effects on cosmic microwave background and large-scale structures. Exploring various possibilities to resolve Hubble tension and Sigma-8 tension was also part of my research. In the last 3 years, I worked mostly on modelling non-gaussianity in upcoming galaxy surveys.
You can look at two packages developed by me:

- 2loop:
    - Calculates the 2nd order matter power spectrum using Standard Perturbation Theory(SPT)

- rsd-bispec:
    - Calculates the multipole moments of redshift-space bispectrum
