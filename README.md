### Welcome to my profile!

Hi all, 

My projects reflect my journey from cosmology to data science 

#### Data Science Projects

- Gen AI and LLM
  - Gather insights from customer reviews using ChatGPT: Notebook
  - Fine-tune the FLAN-T5 model with reinforcement learning: [Notebooks](https://github.com/arindam-mazumdar/GenAI_with_LLM)
    
- <a href='https://github.com/arindam-mazumdar/image_classifiaction_cnn'> Image recognition using Convolutional Neural Network </a>
- <a href='https://github.com/arindam-mazumdar/heart-check'>Heart-Check</a>
  - A <a href='https://heart-check-cdc.herokuapp.com/'>flask app</a> that calculates the risk of heart attack from one's daily habits.
- Domestic power usage prediction
  - A comparison between ARIMA, SARIMA and LSTM

#### Cosmology

I did my PhD on the effect of an early universe process called preheating on Cosmic Microwave Background. During my last two postdoctoral tenures, I worked on different particle physics models and their effects on cosmic microwave background and large-scale structures. Exploring various possibilities to resolve Hubble tension and Sigma-8 tension was also part of my research. In the last 3 years, I worked mostly on modelling non-gaussianity in upcoming galaxy surveys.
You can look at two packages developed by me:

- 2loop:
    - Calculates the 2nd order matter power spectrum using Standard Perturbation Theory(SPT)

- rsd-bispec:
    - Calculates the multipole moments of redshift-space bispectrum
